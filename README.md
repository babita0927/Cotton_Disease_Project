# Cotton_Disease_Project

Welcome to the Cotton Leaf Disease Classification project!

This project is a deep learning CNN model that can accurately classify different types of cotton leaf diseases using a pre-trained model. The project is built using Flask, a micro web framework in Python.

## Getting Started
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository on your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
3. Run the app.py file to start the Flask application.
4. Upload an image of a cotton leaf to the application and submit it for classification.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of images of healthy and diseased cotton leaves. The images were collected from various sources and labeled with the corresponding disease types. The dataset is available upon request.

## Results
The model achieves an accuracy of over 90% in classifying different types of cotton leaf diseases. The model can also identify the type of disease present in the leaf with high accuracy.

## Future Work
Future work on this project can include expanding the dataset to include more images and types of diseases. Additionally, the model can be optimized further to improve its performance.

## Credits
This project was developed as part of an academic project by Babita Patel.
